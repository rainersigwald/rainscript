Stages:

0. normal web sdk project
1. want to use hot new frontend language, but need to compile to JS to run in the browser
   * rns file shows in solution explorer and is part of build output (not usable because browsers don't know about rns)
1. create a task to transpile a file
   * js files created for each rns file?
   * where do we create them? 
     * put them in the js folder?
2. js files not in build output, so breaks when deployed
   * Set as Content, target path, etc. with CopytoOutputDirectory metadata
3. now we have duplicate file errors
   * remove js files in wwwroot from Content
4. how to do it for all rainscript files?
    * input globs on the Copy and Content item creations
5. we're re-doing a lot of work?
    * Inputs and Outputs!
6.
